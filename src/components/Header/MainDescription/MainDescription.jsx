        Hey! I'm Ignacio, a FullStack and Mobile Developer based in Uruguay. I
        began my studies in 2021 on my own, and later in 2022, I started my
        career at Coderhouse. I am fluent in Spanish, and I've also studied
        English (B1). I excel at adapting to teamwork environments, and while I
        may not be the best in the field, I always strive to give my best with
        dedication. I'm opened to learn new technologies.
